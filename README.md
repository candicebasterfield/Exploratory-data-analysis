## Project: Exploratory Data Analaysis for Instacart

Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them. The current datasets are modified versions of publicly data released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition.

In this project, I clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.
